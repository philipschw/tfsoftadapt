    """Internal utility method for estimating rate of change.

    This function aims to approximate the rate of change for a loss function,
    which is used for the 'LossWeighted' and 'Normalized' variants of SoftAdapt.

    For even accuracy orders, we take advantage of the `findiff` package
    (https://findiff.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/examples-basic.html).
    Accuracy orders of 1 (trivial), 3, and 5 are retrieved from an internal
    constants file. Due to the underlying mathematics of computing the
    coefficients, all accuracy orders higher than 5 must be an even number.

    Args:
        input_array: An array of floats containing loss evaluations at the
          previous 'n' points (as many points as the order) of the finite
          difference method.
        order: An integer indicating the order of the finite difference method
          we want to use. The function will use the length of the 'input_array'
          array if no values is provided.
        verbose: Whether we want the function to print out information about
          computations or not.

    Returns:
        A float which is the approximated rate of change between the loss
        points.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the number of points in the `input_array` array is
          smaller than the order of accuracy we desire.
        Value Error: If the order of accuracy is higher than 5 and it is not an
          even number.
